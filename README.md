Text Mining on Survey Responses Using R

In this R code, I am using the libraries "wordcloud" and "tm" to dig into questions of a survey. Using these tools, I was able to clean the data and discover the skills, interests and reasons for new recruits to join an organization. In the end, the code returns wordclouds for the answers and excel files with the word counts.

Note: If anyone else wants to use it, be sure to change the location for the files
